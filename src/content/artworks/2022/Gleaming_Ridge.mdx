description: The beautiful sea of clouds at the top of mountain within its anxious heights.

It's an art inspired from the game [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/) on the Chapter 4 (Golden Ridge).
This art shows how the beauty can only be seen if you worked hard enough to climb this high. Well it is all true like how I worked hard
enough to improve my art skill.

<br/>
It is also anxiously difficult as you progress your art, the more audience you get, the more anxiety you could receive. 
But let's not our anxiety discourage us, in the end, we will reach the top on the mountain we are climbing right now.
