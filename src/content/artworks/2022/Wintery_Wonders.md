It's a last Wintery Wonders art that I am going to make in this whole entire art career, its fun to do this every year but I think I wanted it
to end as it bothers me everytime its winter, and I am pretty much limited to do a winter theme.

Anyway, Fiya is here once again, but this is the last that I am going to invite her in any of my arts.
