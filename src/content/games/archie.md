Archie is a puzzle game that is meant to be just an another prototype game. But it was eventually been continued to have
more content that I want to make it a full game instead. It is originally intended to be just a flip a switch game, but
more game mechanic has been like pushing a box and put it in a bottom, or a player recorder that track your movements and
follows it. Every room is wrapped, and this mechanic is inspired from TowerFall, you had to watch out that if the side is
open, you can go through it and you will be moved into the opposite side of the room.
