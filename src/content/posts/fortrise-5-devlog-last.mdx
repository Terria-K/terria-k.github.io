# Introduction
Hello! Just to let you know about the state of the project once again, but this time, things are
not always a good news. I've recently released the major update of FortRise which is the v5.0, and
while it does not goes smoothly at first, it does get more cleaner and more maintainable API than 
the previous one, and most mods got ported out to v5.0. 

But, the reason why I made this blog once again, is to tell everyone that I am now going to retire
maintaining FortRise soon. 

# Why?
I have been on this project for almost a whole year now, probably not the last year, but this year,
and I have been feeling a lot like my time is being wasted from developing this project over to
my other serious project, which is my game. I have been depressed thinking this for a past two weeks
now, and I think this is probably be the best choice I had to make.

I want to continue my game, not because I had to, but because it is my dream to make one and make it
successful. I had to go and work hard and smarter on this journey, and I am planning to make a team
of five friends to make it.

College life is also one of the reason as well, the school has suddenly going hard on us, and making
the grading system miserable. The preparation for Capstone is also one of the subject that I had to
be aware of, and it seems I have no time in maintaining FortRise.
