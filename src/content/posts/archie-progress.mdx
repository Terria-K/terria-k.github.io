As you may know, Archie has not been actively developed in past 6 months, but
that does not means it is cancelled. So what is going on about the project?

# Game Rewritten

<Image src={archie_rewritten} alt="archie_rewritten"/>

The whole game has been rewritten to my new engine that does not rely on XNA
technology. The engine is called [Riateu](https://github.com/Terria-K/Riateu)
which is made with [MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks) a
free cross-platform game development framework.

This allows me to have more control over to the graphics renderer and I could
make more optimization with the renderer. The current state does not have a
lighting system as of yet, but that is to be implemented soon in the
development.

# Box Physics Improvements
The box physics are still the same as the old one, but there is an improvements
made to it to make it more consistent. When player is pushing the box, the box
no longer have an inconsistent push where sometimes it pushes too far from the
player, causing an unpredictable behavior.

# Button Improvements

Buttons now interact like a solid. Boxes and Player can now step on the button.
While it may sounds like an aesthetic change, it can also change some gameplay.
