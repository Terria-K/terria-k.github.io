As you may know, Archie has not been actively developed in past 6 months, but
that does not means it is cancelled. So what is going on about the project?

# Game Rewritten

<Image src={archie_rewritten} alt="archie_rewritten"/>

The whole game has been rewritten to my new engine that does not rely on XNA
technology. The engine is called [Riateu](https://github.com/Terria-K/Riateu)
which is made with [MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks) a
free cross-platform game development framework.

This allows me to have more control over to the graphics renderer and I could
make more optimization with the renderer. The current state does not have a
lighting system as of yet, but that is to be implemented soon in the
development.

# Box Physics Improvements
The box physics are still the same as the old one, but there is an improvements
made to it to make it more consistent. When player is pushing the box, the box
no longer have an inconsistent push where sometimes it pushes too far from the
player, causing an unpredictable behavior.

# Button Improvements
<Image src={button} alt="button"/>

Buttons now interact like a solid. Boxes and Player can now step on the button.
While it may sounds like an aesthetic change, it can also change some gameplay
and may affect some smaller areas.

# Game Architecture
The rewrite now uses ECS (Entity Component System) with this library called
[MoonTools.ECS](https://gitea.moonside.games/MoonsideGames/MoonTools.ECS). May
drop this depending on the stage of development.

## It does gives some benefits like:
+ Entities are more composable that it makes it easy to think more on the game rather than the whole system for your game.
+ Does not need to keep track the reference, which means it is less of an error
prone.
+ Performant enough and predictable. What you write is what the entities will do.

It significantly improves the game elements, but in a cost of development time
since it is hard to get used to this architecture.
