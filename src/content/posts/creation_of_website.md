Hello, I am Terria Katsura! And this is my first creation of my personal website and is also my first blog too.
The reason why I made my own personal website is because I could store all of my artworks and website that I made within my experiences.
Yes, it is portfolio, and in fact it might help me boost my employment if that will be the case. I did plan to be a freelancer and also
open a commision in both arts and front-end development. That way, I could just help myself a little bit since I am just a first year college student
who want to improve a knowledge more about programming.

<br/>
The website is built with Astro, and the reasoning why I did is because I do not need an extra feature that the new web technology offers.
I want the website to load faster for the visitor to see and won't have an unnecessary load times. Astro is really great for this use cases as
it is just a static site generator and doesn't necessary ship bloated stuff. No or less JavaScript, just HTML and CSS. And it is great for blogs
and portfolio.

<br/>
And that's by far the purpose of this website, it is exactly just a portfolio and a personal blogs for me as well. I will be posting more blogs as
time goes on and share my programming stories to you all. If you want to ask for a commision, you can directly contact me on Discord or email me at: 
**terria@skiff.com** and I'll answer you if I am available to do your request. Don't have a higher expectation for me for now, and you can pay me how much
you want to pay me for the commision.

<br/>
And this is the end of the blog, thanks for reading all of this and have a nice day!
