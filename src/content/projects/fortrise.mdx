FortRise is a main successor to [Bartizan](https://github.com/Kha/Bartizan) a modding framework exists for modding 
[TowerFall Ascension](http://www.towerfall-game.com/).
FortRise did more than just a modding framework, it is a mod loader and an API utility developed with a help of TowerFall community and uses of
[MonoMod](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod) patcher.

## FortRise Features:
+ Mods are loaded inside of a single folder named `Mods`, it can be either a folder or a zip file as long as `meta.json` is present on its root.
+ It does not write anything into the base TowerFall directory, it should only write into its own folder as it should.
+ Uses XML-based limited content scripting and C# with a **latest .NET 10 feature** for advanced scripting.
+ Contains most of a the features of TowerFall that you can create and load directly with a mod such 
as **Levels, Archers, Arrows, etc..** This makes it easy to add new features to the game. 
+ Filesystem API for mods to interact with their own files. 
+ + Mods should not write or read anything outside of its context, but this cannot be enforced directly.
+ File logging across all mods and game logs to help figure out any specific issues to the mods installed.
+ Mods has a containerized* save files, prevents breaking your main save files.
+ Uses [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) which is a stable and powerful patching utility suitable for modding.
> \*While FortRise tried not to touch the main game files and does not exposed direct API to the main save data, mods still has an ability to modify it
by making their own API to touch the save data. Currently, no mods have been reported are touching the vanilla save file yet.
